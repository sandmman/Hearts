HEARTS!
======

### Setup

Clone the repository then run main.py from your console

## How to Play
  The game comes in two modes: single player and simulation. I originally
  built this game as way from me to learn to count cards with the single
  player mode being more of an after thought.

### Simulation mode

Upon startup, the game is in simulation mode and by clicking Next Play on the gui each play will unfold.

### Single Player Mode

To switch to single player mode click on the menu bar under the `File tab`

In single player mode, each player goes one at a time. When its the user's turn, the next_play button will be disabled until a valid card has been selected from the dropdown box and the `selected button` has been pressed.
